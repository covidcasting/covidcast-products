This is a repository of model results, run on Yale's HPC cluster. `dailyRun.sh`
and the `proto-run` directory contain the setup for doing automatic runs every
day. More information coming soon.

**IMPORTANT: this repository is not being updated anymore! Refer to [covidestim.org](https://covidestim.org) for latest model results, and contact us if you need specific archival data.**
